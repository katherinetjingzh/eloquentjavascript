// Building your own programming language is surprisingly easy and enlightening.
// We will build a programming langauge called Egg. It will be a tiny, simple
// language but one that is powerful enough to express any computation you can
// think of. It will also allow simple abstraction based on functions.

// An expression can be a variable, a number, a string, or an application.
